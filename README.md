# SQL-COVID
## About:
### In this project I used PostgreSQL to explore COVID data and Tableau to visualize it. PostgreSQL is an enterprise class open source relational database that supports SQL querying. SQL stands for structured query language and is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. Tableau is a visual analystics platform. The data for this project can be found at ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. For a full description of this project, please visit cpdatasolutions.com/Sql.
